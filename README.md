**I am working on a React-based project that utilizes a public API database to display a dynamic list of movies. The project allows dynamic routing, enabling users to play movie trailers directly on the web page. Additionally, it is capable of filtering movies based on user preferences. The only remaining task is deployment, which I will take care of.
